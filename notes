- How you would go about implementing the solution

* Modifying the chat messge model schema to include an optional tags property.
* Update create message function to allow the creation of tags
* create updateTags and findMessagesByTags functions

- What problems you might encounter

* In some places there may be type errors due to the type of the message object changing

- How you would go about testing

* Add new unit tests for new functions
* Update tests on existing functions, for example: "create" tests instead of just having "successfully creates a message" test, could have "successfully creates a message with tags" and "successfully creates a message without tags" tests

- What you might do differently

* I wouldnt do anything differently
